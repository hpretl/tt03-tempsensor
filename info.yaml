  how_it_works: |
      By creatively twisting the use of a tristate-inverter (EINVP) a voltage DAC is built. This
      voltage-mode DAC is used in another twisted arrangement of an EINVP to bias an NMOS into
      subthreshold operation to discharge a pre-charged capacitor (the input capacitor of an inverter).
      Since the subthreshold current of a MOSFET is a strong function of temperature, the resulting
      delay time is also a strong function of temperature, thus a digital temperature sensor is built.

      The temperature-dependent digital signal is output at the LED dot (io_out[7]).

      io_in[0] is used as a CLK signal, and io_in[1] is used a RESET.

      io_in[7:3] is the 5b DAC code which is applied during the temperature measurement.

      io_in[2] selects whether a full clock cycle is spent in state (0), or the TRANSITION cycle is only
      a few inverter delays (1).

      The state of the internal state machine is shown at the 7-segment LED (0 = RESET, 1 = PRECHARGE,
      2 = TRANSITION, 3 = MEASUREMENT).

      After reset, a period signal with a time-dependent duty cycle is output at io_out[7].

      The inputs at io_in[7:3] can be used to calibrate the time delay as a function of temperature (lower code means longer delay).
