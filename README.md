# Synthesizable Digital Temperature Sensor

(c) 2023 **Harald Pretl and Manuel Moser**, Insitute for Integrated Circuits, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria

This design is intended for inclusion on **the Tiny Tapeout 03** from Matt Venn.

## What does it do?

If a clock signal (nominal 10kHz) is applied, then a period PWM signal is created and output where the duty-cycle is a (nonlinear) function of the on-chip temperature.

By using a calibration, the temperature reading can be re-constructed from this PWM signal.

## How does it work?

TBD

## Usage
